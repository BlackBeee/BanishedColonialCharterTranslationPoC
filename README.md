Colonial Charter Translation Mod Proof of Concept
=========================

This mod provides a framework for translations to the mod "Colonial Charter" for the PC game "Banished".
It is forked from the German Translation Mod by Atomkraftzwerg https://github.com/Atomkraftzwerg/BanishedGermanTranslation
For his Mod: more information is available at the Mod page http://atomkraftzwerg.de/page/banisheddeutsch (only in German).

It provides everything except the String File that must be provided by the "Colonial Charter" Mod Devs from http://www.colonialcharter.com/

This ColonialStringTable.rsc files needs to be put in the /UI/ folder.

After that is done, the ColonialStringTable.rsc file and the /Dialog/StringTable.rsc file need to be translated.

This PoC contains an example special character set to support the german language.

Please exchange the Fonts in /Fonts/ accordingly and update the icon.png and preview.jpg file.
When you set up everything properly, adapt the Package.rsc to your wishes.
