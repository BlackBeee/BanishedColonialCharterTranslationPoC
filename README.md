Colonial Charter Translation Mod Proof of Concept
=========================
Please make sure all .rsc files are saved in UCS-2 Little Endian encoding!

This mod provides a framework for translations to the mod "Colonial Charter" for the PC game "Banished".
It is forked from the German Translation Mod by Atomkraftzwerg https://github.com/Atomkraftzwerg/BanishedGermanTranslation
For his Mod: more information is available at the Mod page http://atomkraftzwerg.de/page/banisheddeutsch (only in German).

Thanks to the Devs from Black Liquid for the Colonial Charter Mod. http://www.colonialcharter.com/

In order to do a translation for your desired language, translate the stings in the
/Dialog/StringTable.rsc
/UI/ColonialStringTable.rsc
files.

This PoC contains an example special character set to support the german language.

Please exchange the Fonts in /Fonts/ accordingly and update the icon.png and preview.jpg file.
When you set up everything properly, adapt the Package.rsc to your wishes.
(name of your package should contain your language to avoid naming conflicts)
